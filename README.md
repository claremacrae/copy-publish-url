# Copy Obsidian Publish URL plugin

This plugin adds a command which lets you copy the URL of a note for your Obsidian Publish site.

Optionally, as of v0.2.0, you can also enable a file menu entry. Thank you to [@Mara-Li](https://github.com/Mara-Li) for the contribution.

It doesn't copy the URL (or show the file menu entry) if the `publish` flag is set to `false`.

## Configuration

In the settings, you need to set your Publish `Index` note and also the base path of your Obsidian Publish site.
